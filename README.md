# Algebraic-Stein-Equations
These MATLAB codes written by Dario Gasbarra ( e-mail:  dario.gasbarra@helsinki.fi)  are used to find Stein equations    for Gaussian polynomial Random variables,  as it is described in the article    "Stein operators for Gaussian polynomials in linear control theory"     by Ehsan Azmoodeh, Dario Gasbarra and Robert Gaunt.
